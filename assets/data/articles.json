    "content": "Postpartum depression is a complex mix of physical, emotional, and behavioral changes that happen in some women after giving birth. It is a form of major depression that can begin during pregnancy or any time up to a year after birth. It is more severe and lasts longer than the 'baby blues,' a term used to describe the worry, sadness, and tiredness many women experience after having a baby. Symptoms of the baby blues usually last for only a few days to a week or two. With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman's ability to care for herself or her family.",
